This project demonstrates how a clean, responsive UI component can be created without relying on frameworks or external libraries. It is designed to run anywhere a modern browser is available, including low-power or constrained environments.

## ✨ Features
* Displays speed in km/h, mph, or m/s
* Built using only the default HTML DOM, CSS, and JavaScript
* No external dependencies or frameworks
* Lightweight and fast to load
* Smooth visual updates with minimal overhead
* Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes

## 🧠 Design Goals
The primary goal of this project was to create a portable and efficient UI component that:
* Can run in any modern browser
* Avoids large frameworks where they are unnecessary
* Maintains visual clarity with subtle styling
* Prioritises performance and simplicity

This makes it suitable for dashboards, embedded displays, kiosks, or educational demos.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* HTML – Semantic structure using the native DOM
* CSS – Styling and layout with no pre-processors
* JavaScript – Logic and dynamic updates using vanilla JS
No build tools, package managers, or third-party libraries are required.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository and open the project directly in your browser:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/big-man-p/speedometer.git
cd speedometer
```
Then open `index.html` in any modern browser.
That’s it — no installation or setup needed.

## ⚙️ Usage
The speedometer can be updated dynamically via JavaScript by changing the speed value and selecting the desired unit:
* km/h
* mph
* m/s

The component automatically updates the display and visuals accordingly.
